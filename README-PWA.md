# PWA Setup Instructions

Your attendance system has been successfully converted to a Progressive Web App (PWA)!

## What was added:
1. âœ… `manifest.json` - App configuration and metadata
2. âœ… `service-worker.js` - Offline caching and PWA functionality
3. âœ… Updated `index.html` with manifest link and service worker registration

## Next steps - Add your icons:

You need to add two icon files to make the PWA fully functional:

1. **icon-192.png** (192x192 pixels)
2. **icon-512.png** (512x512 pixels)

### How to create icons:
- Use your company logo or create a simple attendance-themed icon
- Save as PNG format with the exact names above
- Place them in the same folder as your `index.html`

### Testing your PWA:
1. Serve your project from a local HTTP server:
   - Use VS Code Live Server extension, or
   - Run `python -m http.server` in your project folder
2. Open in Chrome/Edge/Firefox
3. Look for the "Install App" button in the address bar!

### Features you now have:
- âœ… Installable as a native app
- âœ… Offline support
- âœ… App-like experience
- âœ… Splash screen on launch
- âœ… Theme color integration

Your attendance system is now a modern, installable web app! ðŸŽ‰
